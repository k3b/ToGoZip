Easy collection of files from every supporting app into one ZIP file while
being "on the go" or offline.

This collecting "2go.zip" file is like a suitcase in which you can put things (files)
from nearly everywhere (from every app that supports "share"/"send") and
that can travel everywhere (via email, Bluetooth, NFC).

In the beginning this program was developed to collect new Android calendar
entry [ics-files](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/de.k3b.android.calendar.ics.adapter)
in order to transfer them to a desktop PC's calendar.

## Features
* Supports view/send/SendMultiple for file(s), folder(s), URLs and texts.
* Automatic file renaming in the ZIP if the same name with different file date already exists.
* If settings/DebugMode is enabled, processing is logged to logcat and to clipboard as text.
* Settings automatically pop up if the ZIP folder is not writable.

## Donations
If you like this app, please consider [donating to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/donate).

Since Android development is a hobby (and an educational tool) I don't want any money for my apps, so donations should go to projects I benefit from.
